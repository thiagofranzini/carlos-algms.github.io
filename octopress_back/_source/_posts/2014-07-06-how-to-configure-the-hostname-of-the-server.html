<h2>Hostname X FQDN</h2>

<!-- more -->

<h3>Hostname</h3>
<p>
	Hostname is the name that you give to your machine.
	It is used on your local network and is shown at terminal after the name of loged user,
	ex: john@[hostname]. There is no way to access your server remotely with this name.
</p>

<p>
	The name could be anything that start with a letter and can have numbers, undercore and dash.
	Ex: "john-notebook" or "office-pc3" or "plato".
</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code class="bash">$ echo "machine-name" > /etc/hostname
$ hostname -F /etc/hostname
</code></pre>


<h3>FQDN</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Full Qualified Domain Name</strong> is the domain that you pay to register.
	It is the only way that you can access your machine by a name and not by an IP.<br />
	ex: company.com, myblog.net, or restaurant.com.br, it is your choice.<br />
	Configure it is mandatory when you want to have a valid reverse dns.
</p>


<h3>Update /etc/hosts</h3>
<p>
	Here you will configure your external IP followed by your FQDN and your hostname, in that order.
	If yout dont follow that order, you can`t have your reverse dns working.
</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code class="bash">127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
XXX.X.X.X machine-name.domain.tld machine-name
</code></pre>
