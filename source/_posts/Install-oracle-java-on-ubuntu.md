Ubuntu comes with an opensource java installed. To use the oracle's java,
you need to remove the openjkd and install oracle's.

<!-- more -->

First we need to remove the openjdk from Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt-get purge openjdk*
```

Then add webupd8team repository, since Oracle still don't have an official repository.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
```

After the update finished, we can install java via:

```bash
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```
