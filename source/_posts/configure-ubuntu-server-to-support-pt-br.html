<p>
	Every cloud that you use outside Brazil, does not come with pt-br support installed.
	When you access your server via SSH, almost every command that you run on terminal,
	will generate a warn that your language is not supported.
	<!-- more -->
	To avoid this annoying warning, you just need to install the language pack.
</p>

<p>
	Note: This will not translate your Ubuntu, this will only add support to your language and remove the errors.
</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install language-pack-pt-base
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales</code></pre>

<h3>Configure timezone</h3>
<p>
	After install the language-pack, is a good pratice configure the clock of your Ubuntu to reflect the clock of your
	location.
</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code class="bash">
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
</code></pre>
<p>
	First chose America, then SÃ£o Paulo, or your own city.
</p>

<p>
	You can verify the current time by run the command:
</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code class="bash">date</code></pre>
